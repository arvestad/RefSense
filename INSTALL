Here is how to install biblio for you own usage:

1. Move the contents of lib to a lib directory under your
   home directory, for example
	mv lib/biblio ~/lib/
   Set the environment variable PERL5LIB to point to this directory.
   For example by executing
	export PERL5LIB=$PERL5LIB:~/lib/
   if you are a bash user.

2. Move the executables to your bin directory, e.g.
	mv bin/* ~/bin/

3. Make sure that the Perl modules CGI and LWP are installed. This can be done
   with the commands
      perl -e 'require CGI;'
   and 
      perl -e 'require LWP;'
   which should return with no output on success. Use CPAN, if it is
   not installed (see www.cpan.org), by issuing the command
      cpan -i LWP CGI

4. Done.

If you are installing for a department, it is basically the same
procedure. Your sysadm knowns how to adapt these instructions!
