Revision history for Perl extension RefSense.

Version 1.2.1
+ 120815: Cured taxonomy from failing on single-taxa queries. Fixed
	  Removing bug in PubMed.pm.

Version 1.2

+ 120813: Added new program pmid2id for returning, in particular, DOI's
	  from PubMed ID.


Version 1.1

+ 110307: taxonomy now uses XML::Simple to parse IDs. This removes
	  a sad parsing bug.

+ 110307: Added option '-aaa' to pmid2text, meaning "show only
	  abstract. Thanks Ali Tofigh!

+ 090511: Added option '-kp' to pmid2bibtex and changed behaviour
	  of the program. A trailing period in a title is now
	  removed unless the '-kp' option has been issued.

+ 090429: Added option '-ali' to pmid2bibtex. This generates a 
          bibtex key like Arvestad-03 based on first author and
	  year.



1.0  Mon Jan 24 11:36:24 2005
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.22 with options
		-X -n RefSense -v 1.0

+ Implemented suggestion by Glenn Tesler: RefSense now handles
  "collective names", e.g., "ENCODE Project Consortium", properly. It
  is a hack, but it seems to behave in a decent way.

+ pmsearch now accepts two-letter abbreviations in field
  specifications. For example:
    pmsearch title=amino+acid author=arvestad
  is equivalent to
    pmsearch ti=amino+acid au=arvestad

+ New program: taxtree 

  Reads output from 'taxonomy' and deduce a common tree. Some
  examples:
    > taxonomy pig cow horse goat sheep|taxtree
    (((Bos_taurus, (Capra_hircus, Ovis_aries)), Sus_scrofa), 
    Equus_caballus);

    > taxonomy  lion tiger jaguar  lynx |taxtree
    ((Panthera_leo, Panthera_onca, Panthera_tigris), Lynx);

    > taxonomy populus arabidopsis oryza medicago wheat barley | taxtree
    (((Hordeum_vulgare, Triticum_aestivum), Oryza), (Arabidopsis, 
    (Populus, Medicago)));

+ pmid2text, pmid2www
  Change PubMed view mode when using the -p option ("view at
  PubMed"). When a single article is requested, the link to PubMed
  asks for the Abstract mode, but for a list of articles, the Docsum
  view is used. Compare
        pmid2www -p 16752207
  with
	pmid2www -p 16752207,16680195

+ pmid2www
  Open several article views. With the -p option, a single view at
  PubMed is opened, but the default is to have one window for each
  paper. Try for example
	pmid2www 16752207,16680195
  which should open two windows. The maximum number of windows is
  limited to 5 to avoid problems. The user can change that number by
  setting the environment variable REFSENSE_MAXNUM to a sensible
  number.

+ pmid2www
  Environment variables: Uses REFSENSE_BROWSER instead of
  BIBLIO_BROWSER to decide user preference. 

+ Several programs
  Caching of article data can be turned of by setting the environment
  variable REFSENSE_DONT_CACHE. 

  The default behaviour is to avoid asking NCBI for article data by
  looking in /tmp. If the article with PMID 123456 has been viewed
  before (e.g. with pmid2text) then its MEDLINE data has (normally)
  been written to /tmp/pm123456. If a lot of entries are reviewed by a
  script, it may not be desirable to have /tmp fill up. The
  REFSENSE_DONT_CACHE variable simply disables the cache function
  writing to /tmp. It does not prevent reading of alread cached
  entries. 

  Sample usage:
	 > REFSENSE_DONT_CACHE=1 pmid2text < longlist.pmid

+ pmid2format
  New program from Daniel Lundin.
  Create citations in any format.

+ journalcomplete
  New program to assist pubmed and pmsearch. The program works
  together with the completion machiner in bash (and possibly other
  shells) using a file ~/.refsense_journals in the user's home
  directory. 

  A bash user can add the line 
      complete -o default -C journalcomplete pubmed pmsearch
  and then try
      > cp ~arve/.refsense_journals
      > pubmed journal=nat
  and hit the tab key after the "nat" fragment. If everything is set
  up correctly, bash will suggest the following completions:
     Nat+Biotechnol         Nat+Protoc             Nat+Struct+Mol+Biol
     Nat+Cell+Biol          Nat+Rev+Mol+Cell+Biol  Nature
  These strings are all valid input to pubmed/pmsearch. 

  The format of .refsense_journals is simple. One journal per line,
  for example
      Nature Biotech
  and you can add a synonym for a journal too, such as
      J Mol Evol, jme
      Proc Int Conf Intell Syst Mol Biol, ismb


+ pmid2bibtex
  Better generation of Bibtex keys. For example, 
	> pmid2bibtex 16830091
	@article{BerglundSonnhammer16830091,
	  author = {Berglund-Sonnhammer, A.C. and ...
  instead of
	> pmid2bibtex 16830091
	@article{Berglund-Sonnhammer16830091, ...
  (dash removed) and
	> pmid2bibtex 18214976
	@article{delaCruz18214976,
		 author = {de la Cruz, N.B. and ...
  instead of
	> pmid2bibtex 18214976
	@article{de18214976, ... 
  and
	> pmid2bibtex 10903013
	@article{vonHeijne10903013,
		 author = {von Heijne, M. and ...
  instead of
	> pmid2bibtex 10903013
	@article{von10903013, ...
  i.e., the whole name and not just the first string in it is used.
  

+ New program: pmid2connotea
  Given pmids on the command line or from stdin, open a browser
  with the right link to add the article to your Connotea account.
  

  Examples:
	> pubmed primetv | pmid2connotea
  opens a browser window.

  Some articles don't have proper DOI associated at Medline,
	> pmid2connotea 12855432
	PMID 12855432 does not have an associated DOI.
	Consider using pmid2www instead!
  but that is no disaster.
