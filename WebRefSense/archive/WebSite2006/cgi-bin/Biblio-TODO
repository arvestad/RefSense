BibMed: Another frontend to PubMed
----------------------------------

Planned features:

2. Can load an HTML page with refs already gathered at PubMed.

4. More formats easily added. Citation Manager? Word? HTML!

5. Some control over what is saved: You can have the abstract in the
   'annote' field if you please.

6. A complete postscript version of a bibliography can be downloaded
   for pretty printing. You decide the format.

9b User can choose search engine: Google, AltaVista, MetaSearch, et.c.

12. Most cited publications? This could be a cute tool for pruning the
    cache. A file with tuples [PMID #saves last-used-date] is
    kept. Whenever we look at the, say, Top 10, we also remove the old
    and rarely used PMID:s.

13. Upload BibTeX files to BibMed or Trawler for re-searching.

15. In journals participating in PubMedCentral, such as PNAS, you can
    go and find their references! Maybe too much work...

16. Give a help text for how to put a bibmed search box on your
    homepage. 

17. Updating the date on a cache file in order to make it possible to
    remove old and rarely used entries.

18. Try linking into the homepage database.
    (http://hpsearch.uni-trier.de/) 

19. Add LANL preprint archive (xxx.lanl.gov). See HPSearch for how to do
    that. 


------------------------
Implemented features:

1. Simple searching for references. Textboxes for title, author,
   et.c. instead of the complicated PubMed system. Less powerful, but
   more intuitive.

3. Citations can be gathered up into a batch which is then presented
   in BibTeX format. It is also possible to immediately have the
   citation downloaded in BibTeX.

4,somewhat. Now outputting HTML and text ref lists in addition to
   bibtex. 

7. Fast linking into Trawler! Take your batch of citations and see
   what is related to them. 

8. Trawler-links into BibMed. Take your batch of citations from
   Trawler and print/save/manage them as you please.

9a A google search field? Quick google-searches based on author and/or
   title! 

10. Can I hook into CiteSeer? A link should at least be present.

11. To avoid frequent downloading of info from PubMed, a cache could
    be implemented. The XML for an article/whatever is saved in a file
    with same PMID. 

14. Convenient re-search tools. Click on author(s) to get more papers.

20. Offer a tool (URL) for online bibliographies. This means a way of
    constructing a URL query listing the relevant articles (what do to
    with articles not in PubMed?) and anchors to link right into the
    resulting document.

------------------------

Implementation:

Use the CGI module at CPAN. Remember my Trawler modules.

PMID:s are always shuffled around during a session. 

A search parameter is used to find new candidates for the citation
batch.

For the article cache: Consider removing old articles from the cache,
perhaps once a day, *after* having served a page to the user. Also,
remember that a locking mechanism is probably needed for this system. 

For re-searching: Clicking on a search icon by an article brings you
into a search construction page. There, you decide what parts,
i.e. author names, title words, et.c., you want in your search, and
where to send it.
