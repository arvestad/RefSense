    <h1>Manual</h1>

<a href="http://www.sbc.su.se/~arve/refsense">RefSense</a> is a simple interface to PubMed together with a small set of
convenience functions. The target audience is users of 
<a href="http://www.tug.org/">TeX</a>/
<a href="http://tex.loria.fr/index.html">LaTeX</a> and BibTeX who
frequently access
<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/PubMed/">PubMed</a> and do not enjoy
other ways of converting citations into BibTeX format.
<p>
See the <a href="http://www.csc.kth.se/~arve/code/refsense/">RefSense project page</a> for a full overview of the project.
</p>

<h2>Searching</h2>
<img align="right" src="searching.png" border=3>
There are two ways of enter search terms. The first is the simplest,
allowing you to enter simple search words just like at PubMed. You can
use all qualifiers that are available at PubMed to restrict search
terms and construct advanced queries as well. 
<p>
The 'complex search' offers convenient text boxes where you can
construct a more precise query without the PubMed qualifiers. The text
boxes are mostly self-explanatory, but it is helpful to know that
several author names are comma-delimited, and that journal names or
their correct abbreviations should be spelled out fully.

<h2>Search results</h2>
<img align="right" src="searchres.png" border=3>
If the search is successful, a result list is viewed and you can
choose which ones are to be kept in a list while searching for other
citations.
<p>
Sometimes, the author names have a link. This happens when the
Medline entry has an email address in the affiliation field. We can
unfortunately not automatically connect the adress to an individual
author, but you as a user can probably make educated guesses. 
<p>
When the Medline entry contains a URL:s for the article, the article
title will be linked as well. Please notice that the URL:s can
sometimes be outdated!
<p>
If you are only interested in one citation, you also have some options
in the article's quick-buttons. 

<h2>Article buttons</h2>
    <dl>
	<dt><img src="drop.png" alt="Drop!">
	<dd>Remove article from the current listing.
	<dt><img src="bibtex.png" alt="BibMed">
	<dd>Popup a window with the article's BibTeX entry.
	<dt><img src="pubmed.png" alt="PubMed">
	<dd>Popup a PubMed window for that article. This view contains the abstract.
	<dt><img src="websearch.png" alt="WebSearch">
	<dd>Use article data to construct a web search using <a href="http://google.com">Google</a> or <a href="http://citeseer.nj.nec.com">ResearchIndex</a>. The former is suitable to find online versions of an article or the author homepages. ResearchIndex is an excellent search engine indexing the computer science literature available on the Web.
	<dt><img src="bibsearch.png" alt="BibSearch">
	<dd>Let article data form the basis for a new search using RefSense.
	<dt><img src="trawler.png" alt="Trawler">
	<dd>Bring this article over to the <a href="http://genelynx.org/trawler">Trawler</a> system.
    </dl>

<h2>General tools</h2>
<img align="right" src="gentools.png" border=3>
Right now there is only one general tool: Empty the list of
references. This is an easy way to start over. Notice that sessions
are persistent if you stay at one computer since the list of articles
is saved in a browser cookie.

<br clear=both>
<h2>Converters</h2>
<img align="right" src="converters.png" border=3>

When you have assembled a list of references, you can use the
'Converters' menu on the left to format them for either BibTeX, a text
document (email), or HTML.
<p>
There is also an option called 'RefSense link' that offers a simple URL
to be pasted into for example an email. That link also illustrates how
to construct a URL to RefSense that brings up a set of citations. Simply
add a string of the form 
<pre>?pmid=&lt;ID1&gt;,&lt;ID2&gt;,...</pre>
where the 
<code>'&lt;IDn&gt;'</code>
are PubMed identifiers, after RefSense's URL.

<h2>Exporting</h2>
<img align="right" src="export.png" border=3>
The Export menu allows you to bring up the list of articles in another
system --- PubMed, Trawler, and via an options page (WebSearch), 
<a href="google.com">Google</a> or 
<a href="citeseer.nj.nec.com">ResearchIndex</a>.
