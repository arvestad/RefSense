This utility is intended to be used by the completion system in BASH
and in conjunction with the command pubmed. Typical usage is instruct
BASH as follows:

  > complete -C pmcomplete pmid2text pmid2www pmid2bibtex

After a pubmed-search, the result is cached in a file in the user's
home directory and used to filter out candidate PMID:s.

For example:

   > pubmed arvestad savolainen
   11005171   Savolainen P, Arvestad L, Lundeberg J (2000) \"A novel method
              for forensic DNA investigations: repeat-type sequence analysis
              of tandemly repeated mtDNA in domestic dogs.\" J Forensic
              Sci 45(5), 990-999

   10742040   Savolainen P, Arvestad L, Lundeberg J (2000) \"mtDNA tandem
              repeats in domestic dogs and wolves: mutation mechanism studied
              by analysis of the sequence of imperfect repeats.\" Mol Biol
              Evol 17(4), 474-488

Now trying to retrieve the abstract for the paper in J Forensic Sci, we ask
for completion on the text fragment 'for':

   > pmid2text -a for<tab>

This will result in the 'for' string to be converted to 11005171, the proper
PMID. Completion is done on all parts of the search result from pubmed,
including PMID, author names, journal name, and title.
