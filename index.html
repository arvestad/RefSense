        <p>The RefSense system consist of programs for accessing PubMed from the command
line. They allow for searching and viewing hits in the PubMed
database, find related articles, convert to BibTeX (convenient for LaTeX users), and much more by only using a keyboard. And you can get convenient word completion on titles, author names, etc, as well!</p>

<h2>Some available commands</h2>

<h4>pmsearch</h4>

<p>Search Medline and have article identifiers (PMID) returned.</p>

<h4>pmid2text</h4>

<p>Take PMIDs (on the command line or from STDIN) and retrieve the
      entries as text in a couple of formats, including partial HTML
      for building web pages with.</p>

<h4>pmid2bibtex</h4>

<p>Works like pmid2text, but writes bibtex records to STDOUT.</p>

<h4>pubmed</h4>

<p>This is a simple script that essentially executes 
      "pmsearch search terms | pmid2text -a".</p>

<h4>pmid2seq</h4>

<p>Download sequences from PubMed that are refereced, linked, to an
      article. </p>

<p>I have appended the usage texts below. They are also available by
using the "-u" flag. An important and practical feature (at least to
me) is that Medline records are cached on your local computer (in /tmp
actually), making repeated viewing very fast by reducing calls to
PubMed. </p>

<p>Some examples:</p>

<p>How many papers were published by von Heijne last year?</p>

<pre><code>&gt;pmsearch -c year=2002 author=von+Heijne
9
</code></pre>

<p>List them:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;pubmed year=2002 author=von+Heijne
11976343   Vilar M et al (2002) "Insertion and topology of a plant viral
           movement protein in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane."
           J Biol Chem 277(26), 23447--23445

12441395   Nilsson J, Persson B, Von Heijne G (2002) "Prediction of
           partial membrane protein topologies using a consensus approach."
           Protein Sci 11(12), 2974--2978
[snip, 7 more]
</code></pre>

<p>I am open to suggestions that would make theses tools more useful for you.</p>

<p>Cheers,
   Lasse</p>

<hr><pre><code>Usage: pmid2text [&lt;options&gt;] [&lt;pubmed identifier&gt;+]

Options:
  -u       This text.
  -i       No indentation of citations.
  -y       Sort by publication year.
  -a       Show abstract.
  -n &lt;int&gt; Max number of authors without using "et al". Set to
           zero to show all authors.
  -h       Output as HTML for inclusion on a web page.
  -q       Quiet. No extraneous output.

If no PMID is given on the command line, STDIN is read until EOF
and parsed for PMID:s. The expected format is a PMID first on each
line, possibly followed by a space and any string.

----------------------------------------------------------

Usage: pmid2bibtex [&lt;option&gt;] [&lt;pubmed identifier&gt;+]

Options:
  -u   This text.
  -y   Sort by year.

If no PMID is given on the command line, STDIN is read until EOF
and parsed for PMID:s. The expected format is a PMID first on each
line, possibly followed by a space and any string.

----------------------------------------------------------


Usage: pmsearch [&lt;options&gt;] &lt;search terms&gt;+

OPTIONS

  -u         This text.
  -c         Return the number of matching items.
  -d &lt;int&gt;   The maximum number of PMID:s to report. Default: 100.
  -t &lt;int&gt;   The number of days from today to include in search.
  -w &lt;int&gt;   Warn when more than &lt;int&gt; identifiers are returned. Default: 100.


SEARCH TERMS

A search terms is either a lone word that can match anything in a PubMed entry.
The complete query is a conjunction of its terms.

You can for example write 'pmsearch eisen yeast' and get back (at this writing) 31
PubMed identifiers. You may also write these search terms using the PubMed qualifiers
to specify to what record in an entry a term should match. For example, writing
'pmsearch eisen[AU] yeast specifies that 'eisen' is an author. However, since the
PubMed way of writing things is hard to remember (for me at least), a second way of
qualifying terms is implemented. The general syntax in this case is:
  &lt;qualifier&gt;=&lt;term&gt;
where &lt;qualifier&gt; is one of
  author
  abstract
  journal
  title
  year
The previous example is then written as 'pmsearch author=eisen yeast'.

The journal titles can be hard to get right. Use either their full names (e.g.
'Molecular Biology and Evolution') or the official abbreviation ('Mol Biol Evol').
See the PubMed WWW site for details. In addition to the official abbreviations,
pmsearch recognizes some additional common acronyms, which is translated to a name
recognized by PubMed. Currently implemented are:

      Key   Journal
      psb = Pac Symp Biocomput
      jmb = J Mol Biol
     ismb = Proc Int Conf Intell Syst Mol Biol
      jme = J Mol Evol
      nar = Nucleic Acids Res
      mbe = Mol Biol Evol
     embo = EMBO J
     pnas = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A
   cabios = Comput Appl Biosci
      jcb = J Comput Biol
