{"body":"The RefSense system consist of programs for accessing PubMed from the command\r\nline. They allow for searching and viewing hits in the PubMed\r\ndatabase, find related articles, convert to BibTeX (convenient for LaTeX users), and much more by only using a keyboard. And you can get convenient word completion on titles, author names, etc, as well!\r\n\r\n## Some available commands\r\n#### pmsearch\r\nSearch Medline and have article identifiers (PMID) returned.\r\n\r\n#### pmid2text\r\nTake PMIDs (on the command line or from STDIN) and retrieve the\r\n      entries as text in a couple of formats, including partial HTML\r\n      for building web pages with.\r\n\r\n#### pmid2bibtex\r\nWorks like pmid2text, but writes bibtex records to STDOUT.\r\n\r\n#### pubmed\r\nThis is a simple script that essentially executes \r\n      \"pmsearch search terms | pmid2text -a\".\r\n\r\n#### pmid2seq\r\nDownload sequences from PubMed that are refereced, linked, to an\r\n      article. \r\n\r\nI have appended the usage texts below. They are also available by\r\nusing the \"-u\" flag. An important and practical feature (at least to\r\nme) is that Medline records are cached on your local computer (in /tmp\r\nactually), making repeated viewing very fast by reducing calls to\r\nPubMed. \r\n\r\nSome examples:\r\n\r\nHow many papers were published by von Heijne last year?\r\n```\r\n>pmsearch -c year=2002 author=von+Heijne\r\n9\r\n```\r\n\r\nList them:\r\n```\r\n>pubmed year=2002 author=von+Heijne\r\n11976343   Vilar M et al (2002) \"Insertion and topology of a plant viral\r\n           movement protein in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane.\"\r\n           J Biol Chem 277(26), 23447--23445\r\n\r\n12441395   Nilsson J, Persson B, Von Heijne G (2002) \"Prediction of\r\n           partial membrane protein topologies using a consensus approach.\"\r\n           Protein Sci 11(12), 2974--2978\r\n[snip, 7 more]\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am open to suggestions that would make theses tools more useful for you.\r\n\r\n   Cheers,\r\n   Lasse\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n```\r\nUsage: pmid2text [<options>] [<pubmed identifier>+]\r\n\r\nOptions:\r\n  -u       This text.\r\n  -i       No indentation of citations.\r\n  -y       Sort by publication year.\r\n  -a       Show abstract.\r\n  -n <int> Max number of authors without using \"et al\". Set to\r\n           zero to show all authors.\r\n  -h       Output as HTML for inclusion on a web page.\r\n  -q       Quiet. No extraneous output.\r\n\r\nIf no PMID is given on the command line, STDIN is read until EOF\r\nand parsed for PMID:s. The expected format is a PMID first on each\r\nline, possibly followed by a space and any string.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nUsage: pmid2bibtex [<option>] [<pubmed identifier>+]\r\n\r\nOptions:\r\n  -u   This text.\r\n  -y   Sort by year.\r\n\r\nIf no PMID is given on the command line, STDIN is read until EOF\r\nand parsed for PMID:s. The expected format is a PMID first on each\r\nline, possibly followed by a space and any string.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nUsage: pmsearch [<options>] <search terms>+\r\n\r\nOPTIONS\r\n\r\n  -u         This text.\r\n  -c         Return the number of matching items.\r\n  -d <int>   The maximum number of PMID:s to report. Default: 100.\r\n  -t <int>   The number of days from today to include in search.\r\n  -w <int>   Warn when more than <int> identifiers are returned. Default: 100.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEARCH TERMS\r\n\r\nA search terms is either a lone word that can match anything in a PubMed entry.\r\nThe complete query is a conjunction of its terms.\r\n\r\nYou can for example write 'pmsearch eisen yeast' and get back (at this writing) 31\r\nPubMed identifiers. You may also write these search terms using the PubMed qualifiers\r\nto specify to what record in an entry a term should match. For example, writing\r\n'pmsearch eisen[AU] yeast specifies that 'eisen' is an author. However, since the\r\nPubMed way of writing things is hard to remember (for me at least), a second way of\r\nqualifying terms is implemented. The general syntax in this case is:\r\n  <qualifier>=<term>\r\nwhere <qualifier> is one of\r\n  author\r\n  abstract\r\n  journal\r\n  title\r\n  year\r\nThe previous example is then written as 'pmsearch author=eisen yeast'.\r\n\r\nThe journal titles can be hard to get right. Use either their full names (e.g.\r\n'Molecular Biology and Evolution') or the official abbreviation ('Mol Biol Evol').\r\nSee the PubMed WWW site for details. In addition to the official abbreviations,\r\npmsearch recognizes some additional common acronyms, which is translated to a name\r\nrecognized by PubMed. Currently implemented are:\r\n\r\n      Key   Journal\r\n      psb = Pac Symp Biocomput\r\n      jmb = J Mol Biol\r\n     ismb = Proc Int Conf Intell Syst Mol Biol\r\n      jme = J Mol Evol\r\n      nar = Nucleic Acids Res\r\n      mbe = Mol Biol Evol\r\n     embo = EMBO J\r\n     pnas = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A\r\n   cabios = Comput Appl Biosci\r\n      jcb = J Comput Biol\r\n\r\n```","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
