RefSense version 1.0
====================

The RefSense system consist of a few perl scripts plus one simple
convenient Bash-script for accessing PubMed from the command
line. They allow for searching and viewing hits in the Medline
database, and most importantly, also convert records to BibTeX. There
are at least one other shell tool for doing these things but, hey, it
was Not Invented Here! And besides, I like my solution and have
further plans for it.

The scripts are found in ~arve/bin. Here is a quick summary:

pmsearch
   -- Search Medline and have article identifiers (PMID) returned.

pmid2text
   -- Take PMIDs (on the command line or from STDIN) and retrieve the
      entries as text in a couple of formats, including partial HTML
      for building web pages with.

pmid2bibtex
   -- Works like pmid2text, but writes bibtex records to STDOUT.

pubmed
   -- This is a simple script that essentially executes 
      "pmsearch search terms | pmid2text -a".

pmid2seq
   -- Download sequences from PubMed that are refereced, linked, to an
      article.
